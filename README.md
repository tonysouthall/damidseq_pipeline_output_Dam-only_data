# damidseq_pipeline_output_Dam-only_data

If you want to get gff of Dam-only output in your folder you need to include your fastq file with name starting “Dam”, as well as any other DamID fastq file (it can probably even be the same one with a different name). Then you should get the output you are looking for. Please bear in mind that this file will not be properly rpm normalised, so you will have to do this separately.
